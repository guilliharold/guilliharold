## Hello There ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a motivated individual with a strong interest in technology and problem-solving. Iâ€™ve completed the ICT30120 Certificate III in Information Technology and am currently studying the ICT40120 Certificate IV in Information Technology to further develop my technical skills.

I have a keen interest in emergency services and actively contribute as a volunteer firefighter, which has strengthened my teamwork, leadership and decision-making skills under pressure.

I enjoy learning new technologies, working on creative projects and finding efficient solutions to challenges. I value clean design, continuous improvement and delivering high-quality results.
