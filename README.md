## Hi, I’m Harold!

I’m an IT Trainee with a Certificate III in Information Technology and currently studying for my Certificate IV in Information Technology. I enjoy learning new tech skills and applying them to real-world challenges.

Outside of IT, I’m a volunteer firefighter with a strong passion for fire and emergency services. Giving back to my community and being part of a team that helps others is something I truly value.

When I’m not working or volunteering, I indulge my love of cars—particularly as a fan and owner of the iconic Holden Commodore.
