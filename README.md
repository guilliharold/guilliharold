## Hello There ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Harold! Iâ€™m an IT Trainee with a Certificate III in Information Technology and currently studying Certificate IV in Information Technology. Beyond tech, Iâ€™m a proud volunteer firefighter with a strong passion for fire and emergency services.

When Iâ€™m not working or volunteering, youâ€™ll likely find me indulging my love for cars, especially as a fan and owner of the iconic Holden brand.

I enjoy learning, problem-solving and contributing wherever I canâ€”both in IT and in the community.
